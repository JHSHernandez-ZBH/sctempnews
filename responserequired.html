so just right Now, <span class="NOMAD">//////// nomad</span> sent me to a different universe.<br>
apparently, it's thE hub for a <a href=https://laghariportals.com/dashboard/error>teleportation company</a> that He once lived in.<br>
and then someone else teleported me to the <span class="NOMAD">cyberspce_</span>within it.<br>
this means i can remotely access the files, thougH I still need the radio to communicate with people outside of the submulTiverse the company is in.<br>
so i checked with the owner of this website, and they gave Me a song that was supposed to be pLaced in tmx3's second album.<br>
unfortunately, due to conflicts wit#in the band, they cannot upload it to the album anymore.<br><br>
if you want to hear it, take a listen:<audio autoplay loop src="https://jhshernandez-zbh.github.io/sctempnews/Pfizer.wav"></audio><br>
